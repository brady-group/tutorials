    "We just learned how to use our CPU to it's fullest potential by utilizing as many threads as possible to perform calculations (and when not to use it's full potential). Sometimes this can still be slow though. The reason being is that most modern computers only have 4-8 cores which translates into 8-16 threads. While this can provide substantial speed increases, we are often dealing with tens or hundreds of thousands of particles. If time-stepping is important then this number gets multiplied by the number of timesteps, which can easily result in another factor of 1000. When the scales are this big a x8-16 speed increase is definitely noticeable, but still isn't anything to write home about. \n",

Nvidia has a proprietary language known as [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/), which allows you to interface with the GPU architecture. Since there are so many threads working in parallel, there is a more advanced hierarchy needed for getting them to coordinate and work together. \n",

There is some overhead associated with this package as it is a wrapper, but it is much easier than writing CUDA code from scratch. If you wish to write direct CUDA code in C++, then please refer to the documentation above. For documentation related to installing numba for use with CUDA please refer to the page [here](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/index.html). \n",
